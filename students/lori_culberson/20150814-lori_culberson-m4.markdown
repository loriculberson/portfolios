# Lori Culberson * M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
In Module 4 I wanted to improve my Active Record querying skills. I watched videos and read blog posts. I practiced by running queries using different ActiveRecord 'find' methods, compared their SQL statements and query times. This became very helpful knowledge when working on the ScaleUp project. 

After working on IdeaBox.js I realized I needed more practice implementing jQuery in order to change the state of objects. I worked with mentors and reviewed tutorials in order practice. While creating the JavaScript Game my skills continued to improve.

### End of Module Assessment
24 hours of glory! It was a good assessment that was rigorous and fair. I felt comfortable with the content and challenged by the jQuery and features.

### Work

The assignments listed below were individual projects.

#### HubStub ScaleUp
* https://github.com/loriculberson/HubStub
* https://github.com/turingschool-examples/HubStub

## Evaluation Comments
* User perspective: pages feel slow, pagination on the past orders and tickets,
* Performance: no caching, some query optimization with includes and size vs count
* Suggest get together with a group to dive deeper into the backend stuff

* Average Response: 2, seeing about 800ms but at least not 8000ms
* Load Testing: 3, doesn't crash, some decent coverage
* Database Load: Y, good data
* Performance: 2, some good work with with includes and count/vs/size
* Additional Features: 3, pagination and AWS removed


#### ideaBox.js
* https://github.com/loriculberson/idea_box_ajax

On the first pass of this assignment I was able to complete two of the features -- adding and deleting ideaw from the page. Since the due date I completed the features of being able to change the quality and editing each idea. 

## Evaluation Comments
* Reviewed by: Fred
* Features: 1
* UI: 3
* Testing: 3.5
* Rails Style: 3.5
* Ruby Style: 3
* JavaScript Style: 3
* Loved: nice, clean UI with a bit of playfulness for fun.
* Advice: finalize some more features. minor tweak on CSS to make the form mobile-responsive.


## Team

### Projects

The assignments listed below were team projects.

#### Get Me Outta Here

* https://github.com/loriculberson/Fly-Me-Now
* https://get-me-outta-here.herokuapp.com/

Wanna get out of town....fast? With Get Me Outta Here, you can find an airline ticket under $600 to one of ten U.S. tourist destinations. We consumed an airport conversion API, and a flight API, implemented an Angular.js front end and a Rails backend.

## My Contribution
I created the Angular controllers, routers and configured the flight service so the API data could be rendered to the screen. 

## Evaluation Comments
* Completed stated goal to pull real-time flight options in a timely manner
Pretty good testing on rails level, including connections to external APIs

Good:
* use of ruby service objects to abstract job of interacting with external APIs
* Pretty effective at applying angular organization patterns for Services in UI layer
* ruby layer testing seems ok

Bad:
* General sloppyness around code "tidyness" -* comments hanging around, unused files and templates, trailing whitespace, exposed API keys, etc etc
* Angular side feels a little brittle in terms of ability to move things around; points to somewhat weak understanding of what each piece is doing in that portion of the application

* UX is solid; flow is very simple so we only have a couple pages. Would be helpful to have more things clearly labeled in the UI especially when viewing flight results.

* Also all the type is enormous.

## Scores
* Completion: 3
* Organization: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3
* Performance: 3


#### JavaScript Game Time * Black Jack (aka 21)
* https://github.com/loriculberson/blackJack

This classic casino game was my first attempt at writing an entire program in JavaScript. It was challenging for three reasons. First, neither my partner nor I were well versed in JavaScript; second, scoring the Ace proved to be tricky since the value changes based on the total score of the hand; and finally because we were still on the upward slope of learning to test JavaScript. Though the project was difficult, we enjoyed the learning experience.

## My Contribution
* Scoring a dealer and player's hand, resetting the buttons at different stages of the game, scoring of the Ace (still a work in progress), resetting the deck when cards are depleted, clearing the screen when a game ends.

## Evaluation Comments

## Scores (DOUBLE CHECK THESE)
* Completion: 2
* Organization: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Code Quality: 2
* User Experience: 2.5
* Performance: 2

### Giving Feedback

I'm incredibly proud of myself for surviving Turing. 

Lori! You also started the tradition of leading a class for incomers, and that was huge, that helped me a lot coming in. You are such a strong person, being in the same cohort as you for the last couple modules has been inspirational. :tiger2:

Portfolio looks great! I've had a great time working with you and your energy and dedication is always motivational.

Lori: There is nobody that can match your willingness to learn. You have the people skills, the intelligence, and the humility to approach every problem and come out on the other side with a solution. There are no limits to what you will accomplish!

Lori has so much stamina it is unbelievable. She works hard every every day and is always positive. She really took the lead on our personal project, and did an amazing job. She is a pleasure to work with.

I'm constantly impressed with your attitude and work ethic. I really respect your conviction in doing what you know you can do. And you were one of my first friends at Turing and someone as welcoming as you is going to be missed around Turing.

Lori you work so hard and have so much heart. It's really inspiring just to see how much you care and how strong you are. It brings us all up. I loved working with you the few times we paired together.

It's been really great getting to work with you and getting to know you, Lori! You're always ready to put in the hard work and effort on our projects. And as I've mentioned to you â€“ I think you should teach a class on reaching out to mentors and making the most of your network. You've been a great inspiration for lots of people at Turing and I'm so happy I've had the chance to spend time with you!

### Playing a Part
* Created a pre-Module 1 class for new students entering Turing. The class was designed to get new students  familiar with the terminal, basic Ruby syntax, playing in pry, and other topics I struggled to understand when I was in module 1. Since that first class in February, a student has offered to teach it to the newest cohort. 
* Friday, July 10th, Twitter stalked a JavaScript developer a convinced him to become an official Turing mentor.
* Friday, July 24th Asked Ernie Miller to conduct a session on Active Record
* On-going Organized weekly lunch time runs
